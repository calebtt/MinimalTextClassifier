That's interesting, tell me more about it.
We'll circle back to that later.
What do you think happens next?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Let's wrap this up soon.
I was just thinking the same thing.
How about we try something different?
That reminds me of last time.
Anyway, moving on to the next topic.
I don't know, what do you suggest?
My cousin's name is Elena, but she goes by Elle.
Aleena was mentioned in the storybook.
I met someone called Elina at the party.
Alena appears in that old movie.
Helen and Elena are both common names.
The character named Alina escaped the room.
I prefer names like Melon or Helen over others.
Elen is short for something, I think.
Aleena lives next door to us.
In the book, Alena hides from everyone.
I love eating melon in the summer.
Helen Keller is a historical figure.
The bell in the tower rings loudly.
Felon is a word I learned today.
Ellen hosts a great TV show.
Yellen is the Treasury Secretary.
Sellin' lemonade on the street corner.
Tellin' stories around the campfire.
Mellen Camp is a musician I like.
Well, in that case, let's proceed.
The population growth is steady this year.
From one country to another, people move.
The census counts the permanent residents.
Population density varies by region.
New immigrants arrive daily.
The backed-up traffic is due to population increase.
Elena enjoys reading books quietly.
Aleena prefers coffee over tea.
Elina visited the museum yesterday.
Alena bakes cookies on weekends.
Helen went hiking in the mountains.
Melon is my favorite fruit.
Elena is painting in the studio.
Aleena collects stamps as a hobby.
Elina dances to pop music.
Alena watches movies late at night.
And then for the next part, it'll be...
Here and there, things change a bit.
They'll be a surprise waiting.
From the start, it was clear.
But like, what if it doesn't work?
The point they'll make is important.
Newly arrived and ready to go.
Backed by evidence, it's true.
A bit of this and that.
What else could it mean?
